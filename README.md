# Paginator.NET

Simple paginator types assisting in getting paged results.

## To-do

Desperately needs tests and a few demos / how-to, as well as better (any!) documentation. TBD

## A little history

A litte history of these controls may help. Among other things, while these controls were excellently done, a couple things could be a bit modernized, documentation should be added, etc. We'll hopefully get to do this more over time.

These paginator types were for a long time part of a project named [Bootstrap.MVC](https://github.com/copernicus365/Bootstrap.MVC/), with the [first commit](https://github.com/copernicus365/Bootstrap.MVC/commit/b740ebf3d222d5e96a784f36608e45435cfc4717) of these paginator types in that project dating from July 2013. Note that the above repo is private, because it was built on top of the old ASP.NET MVC. Having no future as such, I've not made it public. But see it's ASP.NET Core razor components type successor: [RazorTags](https://github.com/copernicus365/RazorTags), from which I first drew these paginator bits. Now we finally have pulled this out, as should have been, to live as it's own pagination encapsulated type(s): **Paginator.NET**.
